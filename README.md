# Object_Detection_OpenCV
We'll perform a series of operations which i've documented in the code to eventually highlight the biggest strawberry in an image and then draw a green circle around it.

##Dependencies

openCV
matplotlib
numpy
math
You can use pip to install any missing dependencies. And you can install OpenCV using this guide.

##Usage

Run python demo.py to create a new image with the detected strawberry. The last 3 lines at the bottom of demo.py let you define the input image name and the output image name. This detection takes a split second. Deep learning would be more accurate but requires more computation currently. Sometimes you just need to quickly detect an image and don't mind handcrafted which features to look for.
